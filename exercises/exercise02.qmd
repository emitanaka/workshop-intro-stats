The first two exercises are derived from _Whitlock & Schluter (2015) The Analysis of Biological Data_.


## Does Gal치pagos marine iguanas shrink in size to survive El Ni침o events?

Marine iguanas from the Gal치pagos might actually shrink during low food periods caused by El Ni침o events. The `Iguanas` data contain the change in body size (`change.in.length`) for 64 Gal치pagos marine iguanas (_Amblyrhynchus cristatus_) that survived the 1992-1993 El Ni침o event. Conduct a statistical test to determine if the iguanas shrank in size during the El Ni침o event.  


```{webr}
#| edit: false
data(Iguanas, package = "abd")
glimpse(Iguanas)
```

### Exercise 2.1.1

- Plot the histogram of the `change.in.length` variable with 20 bins.


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex1
#| caption: "Exercise 2.1.1"
ggplot(Iguanas, aes(______)) +
  ______(______, color = "white")
```

::: {.solution exercise="ex1"}

**Solution**


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex1
#| solution: true
ggplot(Iguanas, aes(change.in.length)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "white")
```

:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex1
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```


### Exercise 2.1.2

* Conduct a statistical test to determine if the iguanas shrank in size during the El Ni침o event, assuming the change in length is approximately normally distributed. 

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex2
#| caption: "Exercise 2.1.2"
t.test(______, mu = 0, alternative = ______)
```


::: {.solution exercise="ex2"}

**Solution**


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex2
#| solution: true
______(Iguanas$change.in.length, mu = 0, alternative = "less")
```

:::


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex2
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2.1.3


- Based on your answer to the previous question, what is the conclusion of the test using a significance level of 0.05? 

`r webexercises::longmcq(sample(c(answer = "The data suggests that iguanas shrink in size during the El Ni침o event.", "There is no evidence to suggest that iguanas shrink in size during the El Ni침o event.", "There is evidence to suggest that iguanas grow in size during the El Ni침o event.")))`

### Exercise 2.1.4


- What is the 98% confidence interval for the mean change in length of the iguanas during the El Ni침o event? 

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex4
#| caption: "Exercise 2.1.4"
confint(______(______, alternative = ______, conf.level = ______))
```


::: {.solution exercise="ex4"}

**Solution**


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex4
#| solution: true
confint(t.test(Iguanas$change.in.length, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.98))
```

## Does drinking beer attract more mosquito bites for humans?

Mosquitoes find their victims in part by odor, so what people consume many influence the attractiveness to mosquitos. A study in West Africa, opened a container holding 50 mosquitoes next to each of 25 alcohol-free participants and measured the proportion of mosquitoes that left the container and flew toward the participants (they called this proportion the "activation"). They repeated this procedure 15 minutes after each of the same participants had consumed a liter of beer and measured the "change in activation" (after minus before). This procedure was also carried out on another 18 human participants who were given water instead of beer. The change in activation of mosquitoes is given for both the beer-and water-drinking groups.

```{webr}
#| edit: false
beer <- c(0.36, 0.46, 0.06, 0.18, 0.25, 0.18, -0.06, -0.14, 0.12, 0.39, 0.17, -0.16, -0.05, 0.19, 0.25, 0.31, 0.17, -0.03, 0.23, -0.03, 0.26, 0.30, 0.11, 0.13, 0.21)  
water <- c(0.04, 0, -0.08, -0.12, 0.201, -0.039, 0.10, 0.041, 0.02, 0.236, 0.05, 0.097, 0.122, -0.019, 0.021, -0.08, -0.165, -0.28)
mosquito <- data.frame(change = c(beer, water), 
                       group = rep(c("beer", "water"), 
                                   c(length(beer), length(water))))
```

### Exercise 2.2.1

- Draw a boxplot, superimposed with the stripchart, for each group to compare the change in activation of mosquitoes. 

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex5
#| caption: "Exercise 2.2.1"
ggplot(mosquito, aes(______)) +
  ______() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.05)
```


::: {.solution exercise="ex5"}

**Solution**

Since there are not too many observations per group, stripchart helps us to see the distribution of the individual data points. Boxplot depicts a five number of summary statistics (minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum) and can sometimes mask subtle details in the data. 

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex5
#| solution: true
ggplot(mosquito, aes(group, change)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.05)
```



:::


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex5
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2.2.2

- Is there evidence to suggest that drinking beer attracts more mosquito bites than drinking water? Assuming that the change in activation of mosquitoes is approximately normally distributed, conduct a statistical test to answer this question. 



```{webr}
#| exercise: ex6
#| caption: "Exercise 2.2.2"
______(beer, water, alternative = ______)
```


::: {.solution exercise="ex6"}

**Solution**


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex6
#| solution: true
t.test(beer, water, alternative = "greater")
```

:::


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex6
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2.2.3

- Based on your answer to the previous question, what is the conclusion of the test using a significance level of 0.01? 

`r webexercises::longmcq(sample(c(answer = "There is strong evidence to suggest that drinking beer attracts more mosquitos.", "There is no evidence that the change in activation of mosquitos is different between drinking beer and water.", "There is evidence to suggest that drinking water attracts more mosquitos.")))`


## Is this pesticide claim true?

A farmer is testing a new pesticide with claims that it is more effective than the standard pesticide, which successfully protects 70% of crops from insect damage. To test this, the farmer applies the new pesticide to 40 plants and observes that 32 of them remain undamaged. 


### Exercise 2.3.1

- Assuming that plants are homogeneous and no other factors are involved, conduct a statistical test to determine if the new pesticide is more effective than the standard one.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex8
#| caption: "Exercise 2.3.1"
______(x = ______, n = ______, p = ______, alternative = ______)
```

::: {.solution exercise="ex8"}

**Solution**


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex8
#| solution: true
binom.test(x = 32, n = 40, p = 0.7, alternative = "greater")
```

:::


```{webr}
#| exercise: ex8
#| check: true
gradethis::grade_this_code()
```

### Exercise 2.3.2

- Based on your answer to the previous question, what is the conclusion of the test using a significance level of 0.05? 

`r webexercises::longmcq(sample(c("There is strong evidence to suggest that the new pesticide is more effective than the standard one.", answer = "There is no evidence that the new pesticide is more effective than the standard one.", "There is evidence to suggest that the new pesticide is less effective than the standard one.")))`
