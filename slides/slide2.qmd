## [Is this coin unbiased?]{.page-concept}


```{webr}
#| include: false
options(width = 75)
```

```{r coin}
set.seed(1)
head <- '<img src="/images/Australian_Fifty_Cents_Obv.jpg" style="vertical-align:middle;height:1.4em;">'
tail <- '<img src="/images/Australian_50c_Coin.png" style="vertical-align:middle;height:1.4em;">'
```

* Suppose I have a coin that I'm going to flip `r tail` 
* If the coin is unbiased, what is the probability it will show heads?
* Yup, the probability should be 0.5. 
* So how would I test if a coin is biased or unbiased?
* We'll collect some data. 
* **Experiment 1**: I flipped the coin 10 times and this is the result:

<center>
```{r coin-bias, results='asis'}
samp10 <- sample(rep(c(head, tail), c(7, 3)))
cat(paste0(samp10, collapse = ""))
```
</center>

* The result is 7 head and 3 tails. So 70% are heads. 
* Do you believe the coin is biased based on this data?

## [Testing coin bias]{.page-concept}

* **Experiment 2**: Suppose now I flip the coin 100 times and this is the outcome:

```{r coin-bias100, results='asis'}
samp100 <- sample(rep(c(head, tail), c(70, 30)))
cat(paste0(samp100, collapse = ""))
```

* We observe 70 heads and 30 tails. So again 70% are heads. 
* Based on this data, do you think the coin is biased?


## [Null hypothesis significance testing]{.page-concept}

**Hypothesis and Assumptions**

* Suppose $X$ is the number of heads out of $n$ independent tosses.
* Let $p$ be the probability of getting a head for this coin.


- **Hypotheses**:   $H_0: p = 0.5$ vs. $H_A: p \neq 0.5$   
- **Assumptions**:  Each toss is independent with equal chance of getting a head.   

## [Null hypothesis significance testing]{.page-concept}

**Test statistic, Verify and Conclusion**

- **Test statistic**: $X \sim B(n, p)$. Recall $E(X) = np$.<br> The observed test statistic is denoted $x$. 
- **Verify**: P-value $P(\mid X - np\mid \geq \mid x - np\mid )$, critical value or confidence interval
- **<i class="fas fa-gavel"></i> Conclusion**: Reject null hypothesis when the $p$-value is less than some **significance level** $\alpha$. Usually $\alpha = 0.05$.

## [Binomial test (one-sided)]{.page-rproj}

$H_0: p = 0.5$ vs. $H_A: p > 0.5$

```{webr}
binom.test(7, 10, 0.5, alternative = "greater")$p.value
```

$H_0: p = 0.5$ vs. $H_A: p < 0.5$

```{webr}
binom.test(7, 10, 0.5, alternative = "less")$p.value
```


## [P-values]{.page-concept} 

- {{< fa solid gavel >}} Reject null hypothesis when the $p$-value is less than some **significance level** $\alpha$. 
- Usually $\alpha = 0.05$.



- The p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one observed, under the null hypothesis $H_0$.
- If the p-value is small, it suggests that the observed data is unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis.
- A high p-value suggests that the observed data is consistent with the null hypothesis, it doesn't mean that the null hypothesis is true.

Popular misconception:

- The p-value is **_not_** the probability that the null hypothesis is true or false.

- Remember that NHST is a test of significance, not a test of acceptance or truth.

## [Binomial proportion confidence interval]{.page-rproj}

::: box

A **confidence interval** is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the parameter.

:::

- A (two-sided) 95% confidence interval for $p$ (using Clopper and Pearson method) is given as:

```{webr}
#| autorun: true
binom.test(7, 10, conf.level = 0.95)$conf.int
```

- If $H_0: p = p_0$ vs $H_A: p \neq p_0$ and the $100(1-\alpha)$% confidence interval contains $p_0$, then we fail to reject the null hypothesis at $\alpha$ significance level.
- $\alpha = 0.05 \rightarrow 95$% confidence interval is a common choice. 

## [Power of a hypothesis test]{.page-concept}

- The **power** of a test is the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true.

. . . 

```{webr}
#| autorun: true
sapply(0:5, \(x) binom.test(x, 5, 0.5)$p.value)
```

. . . 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r}
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-width: 8
ggplot(data.frame(x = 0:5, p = sapply(0:5, \(x) binom.test(x, 5, 0.5)$p.value)), aes(x, p)) +
  geom_col() + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.05, linetype = "dashed", color = "red", linewidth = 2) +
  labs(x = "Number of successes", y = "P-value") + 
  scale_y_sqrt()
```



:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

<br>

For $H_0: p = 0.5$ vs. $H_A: p \neq 0.5$, if the number of trials is 5, then it doesn't matter what your test statistic is, the p-value is always greater than 0.05!

<br>

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> This means that this test has **zero power**.

## [Type 1 and 2 errors]{.page-concept}

| | Probability to reject $H_0$ | Probability to not reject $H_0$ |
---|:---:|:---:|
**If $H_0$ is true** | $\alpha$ |  $1 - \alpha$ |
**If $H_A$ is true** |  $1 - \beta$ | $\beta$ |

## [One-sample t-test: testing for the mean]{.page-concept}

$H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ vs. $H_A: \mu \neq \mu_0$

Sample $n$ times from a population with mean $\mu$.

- **Assumptions**: Population data is normally distributed, or otherwise the sample size $n$ is large.
- **Test statistic**: $t = \dfrac{\bar{X} - \mu_0}{S/\sqrt{n}} \sim t_{n-1}$, where: 
  - $\bar{X}$ is the sample mean, 
  - $S$ is the sample standard deviation, 
  - $n$ is the sample size.


## [One-sample t-test: P-value]{.page-rproj}

- **Verify**: P-value = $P(|t| \geq |t^*|)$

```{r}
#| fig-height: 5
data.frame(x = seq(-5, 5, 0.01)) |> 
  mutate(p = dt(x, df = 5)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x, p)) +

  geom_ribbon(data = ~. |> filter(x >= qt(0.9, df = 5)),

                     labels = c("-|t*|", "0", "|t*|"))
```

## [Two-sample t-test: testing for the difference in means]{.page-concept}

- Sample $n_1$ times from population 1 with mean $\mu_1$.
- Sample $n_2$ times from population 2 with mean $\mu_2$.
- Sampling from populations 1 and 2 should be independent.

$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ vs. $H_A: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$

- **Assumptions**: Both populations are normally distributed (or sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ are sufficiently large).
- **Test statistic**: $t = \dfrac{\bar{X}_1 - \bar{X}_2}{\sqrt{\dfrac{S_1^2}{n_1} + \dfrac{S_2^2}{n_2}}} \sim t_{n_1 + n_2 - 2}$, where: 
  - $\bar{X}_i$ and $S_i$ are the sample mean and standard deviation, respectively, of population $i$.
- **Verify**: P-value = $P(|t| \geq |t^*|)$

## [Paired t-test: testing for the difference in means]{.page-concept}

- Sample $n$ times from a population with observation pairs.
- $d_i = X_{1i} - X_{2i}$ is the difference between the two observations in pair $i$.
$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$ vs. $H_A: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$
$H_0: \mu_d = 0$ vs. $H_A: \mu_d \neq 0$
