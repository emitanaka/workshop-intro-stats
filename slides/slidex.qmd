# Ethical statistical practice

- Avoid cherry-picking, data dredging, HARKing (hypothesing after the results are known), fishing, p-hacking and selective reporting.
- See more on [**Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice**](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/ethicalguidelines.pdf?Status=Master&sfvrsn=bdeeafdd_6/) prepared by the Committee on Professional Ethics of the American Statistical Association.

- <i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Beware of blindly using statistical tools -- if you are not sure whether a particular statistical method or tool works, **in-silico experiments** are a great way to find out! You can, for example, 
  - Use ChatGPT or other LLM to give you R code to simulate data for you, and
  - Analyse the data using R.
  - Then check the result with respect to the data generating process. 
- Take the time to understand how your statistcal tools and methods work.
